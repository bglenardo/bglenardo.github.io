The nuclear level structure of <sup>136</sup>Cs is of interest for two major reasons:

1. <strong><sup>136</sup>Cs is the intermediate nucleus in the double-beta-decay of <sup>136</sup>Xe.</strong> It can therefore be used to benchmark nuclear models, which are the leading source theoretical uncertainty in the interpretation of 0&nu;&beta;&beta; experimental results. In particular, low-lying excited states in <sup>136</sup>Cs can contribute to sub-leading terms in the calculation of matrix elements for both 0&nu;&beta;&beta; and 2&nu;&beta;&beta; in <sup>136</sup>Xe, and therefore are of fundamental importance for experiments like nEXO.

2. <strong>Charged-current reactions on <sup>136</sup>Xe nuclei will produce excited <sup>136</sup>Cs nuclei in the final state, which would then emit characteristic gamma rays which could be used to tag these rare interactions</strong> in large-scale liquid xenon experiments such as LZ or nEXO. Of particular interest: this reaction is sensitive to the neutrinos produced by the solar CNO cycle, which
provide information on the abundance of heavy elements (specifically carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) in the sun’s core. New measurements may help solve the long-standing tension between different models of the solar composition (the so-called “solar metallicity problem”). Furthermore, there are theories of dark matter that predict new particles which undergo similar absorption reactions (i.e., <sup>136</sup>Xe +  &chi;  &rarr; <sup>136</sup>Cs + e<sup>-</sup>). My collaborators and I have shown that, with dedicated analyses to search for <sup>136</sup>Cs decays, next-generation liquid xenon TPCs may be uniquely sensitive to these signals (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.072009">PhysRevD.102.072009</a>).


<strong>Despite its importance, there are only a handful of measurements of <sup>136</sup>Cs to date, and its nuclear properties remain largely unknown. </strong> To remedy this, we are engaged in a series of experiments at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) in Durham, NC that will characterterize the level scheme and relaxation of excited states in <sup>136</sup>Cs. We bombard a <sup>136</sup>Xe gas target with protons accelerated to 7 MeV, producing <sup>136</sup>Cs via the Xe(p,n)Cs reaction.
