While I was a postdoc, we developed the first <strong>self-triggering time projection chambers using room-temperature liquids.</strong> Specifically, we built and operated a TPC filled with tetramethylsilane that could be triggered on the Cherenkov light produced by fast charged particles, enabling fully 3-dimensional event reconstruction. Such detectors are dramatically simpler to operate than noble liquid TPCs, as they do not require cryogenic infrastructure. Potential applications include:
  - <strong>High-fidelity imaging of neutrino interactions</strong>, as suggested in [Dawson and Kryn, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/9/07/P07002). A large-scale version of this technology could produce precise 3D images of the various final-state particles from neutrino inverse beta decay on hydrogen, enabling strong background suppression and, possibly, the reconstruction of directional information.
  - <strong>Novel PET scanners.</strong> TPCs made of TriMethyl Bismuth (TMBi) have been proposed as a [new technique for positron emission tomography](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6708477), due to the relatively high Z of TMBi and the excellent position resolution afforded by the TPC technique.
  - <strong>Directional dark matter detectors.</strong> There is evidence that the orientation of a particle track relative to the applied electric field changes the charge yield in organic liquids, thanks to columnar recombination of the electron/ion pairs. Correlating the directional information of particle interactions with the detector's orientation relative to the expected direction of dark matter particles has been proposed as a technique for discriminating possible DM signals from backgrounds.
  - <strong>Neutron imaging</strong> The possibility of directional information and high-precision vertex localization, in addition to the abundance of hydrogen in organic liquids, could in principle allow such detectors to perform neutron imaging using multiple scattering.


While I am no longer directly involved, this work continues in the [Gratta Group at Stanford](http://grattalab3.stanford.edu/neutrino/index.html).
