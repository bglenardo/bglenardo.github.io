<i>Under construction</i>

During my postdoc in Giorgio Gratta's group at Stanford Univeristy, we developed the first self-triggering time projection chambers using room-temperature liquids. Such detectors are dramatically simpler to operate than noble liquid TPCs, as they do not require cryogenics and related infrastructure. If scalable, they could be used for high-fidelity imaging of neutrino interactions (proposed in {}) or possibly for direction searches for dark matter. 

WE did this that and the other thing.

This work continues in the [Gratta Group](http://grattalab3.stanford.edu/neutrino/index.html).
