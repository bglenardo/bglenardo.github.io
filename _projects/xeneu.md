Dual-phase xenon detectors are the leading technology in the search for , thanks to their scalability, low backgrounds, and low thresholds. The current generation of xenon-based experiments are gearing up

        Multi-tonne scale, dual-phase xenon detectors are the leading detector technology in the search for dark matter particles
        We have an ongoing program of experiments to calibrate nuclear recoil signals in xenon detectors in regimes that are not well covered by existing data.

        In 2019, we brought the XeNeu detector to TUNL to perform calibration measurements at lower energies than had ever been achieved. We successfully measured nuclear recoil signals down to single ionization electrons -- characterizing liquid xenon response at the absolute detection limit! These results enable dark matter experiments like LZ or XENONnT to expand their WIMP searches to lower masses.

        More recently, we performed high-energy (>100 keV) calibration measurements in the laboratory at LLNL (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.052013">PhysRevD.106.052013</a>). These data will help LZ/XENONnT model the signals from more exotic dark matter models, such as <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.64.043502">inelastically-scattering dark matter</a> or dark matter with <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2013/02/004">momentum-dependent interactions</a>, for which low-energy recoils may be suppressed.
