Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are a leading technology in direct searches for dark matter particles, thanks to their scalability, low backgrounds, and low thresholds. These experiments are primarily searching for rare low-energy (1-100 keV) nuclear recoil signals, which would be produced by the elastic scattering of dark matter particles off of the xenon nuclei in the detector. 


The XeNeu program is a detector R&D effort to characterize dual-phase xenon detectors in ways that extend their reach to a wider array of possible dark matter candidates. The experimental platform is a prototype dual-phase xenon TPC that we built while I was a graduate student at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).

#### <strong>Neutron scattering calibration experiments</strong>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        The primary goal of the XeNeu program is to calibrate the observable signals (ionization and scintillation) produced by nuclear recoils in liquid xenon, in regimes that are not well characterized by existing data. This is done using elastically scattered neutrons produced by either an accelerator source or standalone neutron generators. By collimating the incoming neutrons and tagging the outgoing neutrons with external detectors, we create fixed-energy nuclear recoils in the liquid xenon and calibrate its response to the types of signals we expect from dark matter interactions. 
        <!-- Our measurements benchmark the signals expected from dark matter particles in a wider range of models, allowing xenon-based experiments like LZ and XENON to extend their physics reach into new parameter space. -->

        In 2019, we brought the XeNeu detector to the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) to perform calibration measurements at lower energies than had ever been achieved. We successfully measured nuclear recoil signals down to single ionization electrons -- characterizing liquid xenon response at the absolute detection limit! These results enable xenon detectors to search for dark matter particles at lower masses than were previously accessible, down to about ~1 GeV (roughly the mass of the proton).

#### <strong>Other detector R&D</strong>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        In addition to calibration measurements, we also perform basic detector R&D that is important for understanding detector performance in dark matter experiments. At right, I show a measurement of the efficiency for extracting electrons from liquid xenon into the gas phase that we published in 2019. The extraction efficiency plays an important role in the overall efficiency for detecting ionization signals in experiments like LZ.
