The LUX experiment was the world's most sensitive search for WIMP dark matter between 2013 and 2016. Along with the XENON class of experiments, it paved the way for modern direct dark matter searches by developing many new techniques for low-background dark matter searches with large-scale xenon TPCs.

I worked on LUX as a part of my PhD. My primary projects were:
<ul>
    <li> 
        <strong>Co-leading the analysis of scintillation pulse timing and low-energy pulse shape discrimination (PSD)</strong>. We made the first direct measurements of the singlet-to-triplet ratio for low-energy nuclear recoil events, providing valuable data for modeling the scintillation emission profile of liquid xenon. We also developed a new PSD-based background discriminant for LUX.
    </li>
    <li> 
        <strong>Fitting models of ionization and scintillation yields to neutron scattering calibration data</strong>. Led by the Brown group, LUX pioneered a new calibration technique using a DD neutron generator to produce <em>in-situ</em> nuclear recoil signals. I worked on propagating these data into the LUX signal modeling software, allowing more robust predictions of the expected signals from DM.
    </li>
</ul>
