<i>Under construction</i>

The isotope <sup>136</sup>Cs is of great interest for a variety of reasons: it is the intermediate nucleus in the double-beta-decay of <sup>136</sup>Xe, and it is the isotope that gets produced by charged-current reactions on <sup>136</sup>Xe. To remedy this, we are engaged in a series of experiments at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) in Durham, NC that will characterterize the level scheme and relaxation of excited states in <sup>136</sup>Cs.
