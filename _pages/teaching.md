Since 2019, I have been a volunteer faculty member with [Mount Tamalpais College](https://www.mttamcollege.org/) (formerly the Prison University Project), which operates an accredited, two-year liberal arts college program inside San Quentin State Prison in Northern California. I have served as both a study group leader and instructor for math and science classes. 

Most recently, I led a team that developed and taught the program's first Introduction to Astronomy class, which we offered in the Spring 2022 semester. 

I was interviewed about my experience with Mt. Tam for an article in Physics Today, which can be found here: [https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4471](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4471)
