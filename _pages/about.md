I am an experimental physicist studying fundamental particles and their interactions. In particular, I specialize in the development of instrumentation and techniques for ultra-low-background experiments searching for rare processes. My primary project at present is the nEXO experiment, which will search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe using a liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC). I am also involved in the development of detectors to search for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) and WIMP dark matter, and more broadly, the development of new radiation detection techniques with a variety of applications.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
