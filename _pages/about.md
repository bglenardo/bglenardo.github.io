I'm an experimental particle physicist working in the [Fundamental Physics Directorate at SLAC](https://sites.slac.stanford.edu/fundamental-physics/). My research is centered around some of the big open questions in modern physics: 
  - Why is the universe full of matter and not antimatter? 
  - What is the nature of dark matter?
  - How do neutrinos obtain their masses?
  - Is lepton number conserved?
  - What else can next-generation particle physics experiments teach us about the cosmos?

Most of my work to date has focused on developing hardware and software for experiments searching for rare phenomena using liquid xenon time projection chambers (TPCs), a highly-scalable detector technology that provides 3D imaging of interactions and enables extremely low-background searches for new physics. 
<!--
My primary focus at present is the nEXO experiment, a next-generation search for neutrinoless double beta decay in <sup>136</sup>Xe. I am also involved in the development of low-threshold xenon detectors to search for WIMP dark matter and possibly for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scatter (CE&nu;NS), and more broadly, the development of new radiation detection techniques with a variety of applications.
