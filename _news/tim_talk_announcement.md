Prof. Tim Daniels will give an invited talk on our [charge-exchange reactions program](projects/2_project) at the Fall 2022 Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics! He'll present new results from our most recent experiment, which measured &gamma;-rays emitted by newly-identified nuclear transitions in <sup>136</sup>Cs. The session information can be [found here](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DNP22/Session/GD).
